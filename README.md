# GAN Model for Cat and Dog Image Generation

This project is focused on building a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating images of cats and dogs. While the basic structure of the model has been implemented, **the project is still incomplete** and requires further work to achieve satisfactory results.

### Project Overview
The aim of this project is to train a GAN model using TensorFlow to generate realistic images of cats and dogs. The architecture consists of:

1. **Generator**: Produces synthetic images from random noise.
2. **Critic (Discriminator)**: Evaluates the authenticity of images, distinguishing between real and generated ones.

### Dataset
The [Cat vs Dog dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/alicolak46/catvsdog) from Kaggle is used for training. It includes labeled images of cats and dogs.

### Current Status
At this stage, the project is **not fully functional**:
- The model is capable of generating images, but the output quality is far from realistic.
- Training has been attempted, but additional data and more refined training techniques are needed to improve performance.

### Known Issues
- **Inadequate Data**: The model's accuracy and ability to generate clear images are limited by the current dataset.
- **Training Quality**: Further fine-tuning of the model's hyperparameters and more extensive training are required to get better results.

### Future Work
This project is a work in progress and needs more development to reach completion. Planned improvements include:
- Enhancing the modelâ€™s architecture for better image generation.
- Adding more diverse and extensive datasets.
- Fine-tuning training strategies and optimization.

In its current state, this project is a foundation, and significant additional work is required before it can generate high-quality images.
